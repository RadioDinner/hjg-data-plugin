# Feature backlog

Planned features to build **later** — captured here so they aren't lost. Each
entry has enough context (what, why, where in code, acceptance criteria) to pick
up cold. When one ships, move it to "Shipped" at the bottom (or delete it and note
it in `HANDOFF.md`). Newest ideas on top.

> Orientation: read `HANDOFF.md`, `new_session_instructions.md`, and the north
> star in `CLAUDE.md` first. North star = *every metric viewable as a graph AND a
> table at the same time.*

_No planned items right now — the backlog is clear. Add new ideas above this line
(newest on top), then move them to "Shipped" when done._

## Shipped

### Pay staff "Explore" — coach dropdown scoped to the active view — session 006, 2026-06-22

The **Coach** filter in the Pay-staff "Explore source data" window now lists only
coaches with **≥1 row in the active view** (Ledger / Invoices / Engagements) under
the **current month range, tier, and text filters** — not every coach in the whole
dataset. The options are computed from everything **except** the coach filter
itself, so picking a coach never collapses the dropdown to just that coach. "All
coaches" stays first; if the selected coach drops out of the options (e.g. after
narrowing the month range or switching views) it auto-falls-back to All coaches so
the table isn't stuck empty behind a stale selection. Invoices (no native coach)
use the engine's per-month attribution (`coachByClientMonth`). The `overlaps`
month-range predicate was factored out and shared with the Engagements view.
`src/components/PayExploreModal.tsx`.

### Metrics "Compare" mode (period vs period) — session 006, 2026-06-22

Toggle on the Metrics page to compare **Period A vs Period B**. Shipped as
**"Both"** (the user's choice): a board **scorecard** card — grouped A/B bars for
the four headline KPIs plus a delta table covering *every* metric with Δ
(absolute) and Δ% (vs Period B) — **and per-chart overlays**: Period B is drawn
as a paired bar on the bar charts and a dashed reference line on the line /
composed charts, and each card's table gains B + Δ columns in compare mode.
Presets **MoM / QoQ / YoY** auto-derive a **span-aligned** Period B from Period A
(so year-to-date stays comparable to year-to-date), plus free **custom** A/B
ranges. Pure math in `lib/compare.ts` (`shiftMonths`, `derivePeriodB`, `delta`),
re-exported through `src/db.ts`; locked by **verify §10**. Toggling compare off
returns the view to the exact single-period state (acceptance #1).
