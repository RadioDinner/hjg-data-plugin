# Session 006b — 2026-06-22

Worked the feature backlog newest-first, committing straight to `main` (per the
user's standing instruction this session). Branch note: the container checked out
a local `claude/compassionate-hawking-ze8a1j` branch pointing at the same commit as
`origin/main`; the remote has only `main`. Fast-forwarded local `main` to
`origin/main` and committed there.

## What shipped (all on `main`)

1. **`3012acd` — Build payout: interactive review/builder tab (backlog #1).**
   New top-nav **"Build payout"** tab (full sub-view, the user's choice over a
   modal). Pick a mentor + service month → every engine-computed line is listed with
   an **include/exclude** checkbox and a **per-line override + note**; a **running
   total** side panel updates live (built vs engine total, delta, counts). Reviews
   **persist** to a new HJG-owned `payout_builds` table — **Save draft → Approve →
   Reopen**, **Discard**, **CSV export**; month dropdown badges saved months. Engine
   numbers are never mutated (overrides live only in the review record; read-only
   toward CA). Pure math in `lib/payBuild.ts` (re-exported via `db.ts`), locked by
   **verify §13** (18 new assertions). `payout_builds` added to the Raw-data viewer;
   "Build payout →" cross-link button on the Pay-staff tab.
   - **NEW migration `9989_payout_builds.sql`** (staff RLS, unique per coach+month) —
     **must be applied** or Save/Approve/Discard error.

2. **`233a92d` — Data map → its own in-app tab (backlog #1, was #2).**
   The data-relationship map is now a **top-nav tab** ("Data map", between Raw data
   and Admin) via `src/views/DataMapView.tsx`, which embeds the existing static D3
   page (`/data-map.html`) in an **iframe** (fast/faithful; native-React + live
   Supabase is the later upgrade) with a "Full screen ↗" link. Old Raw-data button
   removed. No migration.

3. **`7604b38` — Contextual help: "?" drawer framework + seed articles (backlog, was #3).**
   Reusable `HelpButton` opens a right-side **slide-in drawer** with a short explainer
   (Esc / click-away / Close dismiss; focus into drawer; `role="dialog"`). Articles are
   Markdown strings in `src/help/articles.ts` keyed by `helpId`; tiny dependency-free
   renderer + drawer in `src/components/HelpDrawer.tsx`. Wired additively via an optional
   `helpId` prop on `ChartCard` (Metrics: Discovery, Meetings, Active mentees, Mentors,
   Discovery→conversion, Compare) + standalone buttons on Pay staff, Build payout, and
   the Journeys pipeline-timing card. No migration.

4. **`bd22262` — Metrics: sticky range bar + Discovery→conversion drill-down (backlog, was #5/#6).**
   - **Sticky range bar:** presets + dates + Compare toggle freeze to the top of the
     Metrics page while scrolling (`.range` → `position: sticky; top: 0`, solid bg +
     z-index + border). Pure CSS.
   - **Conversion drill-down:** clicking a bar in the Discovery→conversion chart opens
     the Explore modal **pre-filtered to that month's** discovery calls (titled e.g.
     "Discovery calls — Jun 2026"). Month key threaded via a `_key` chart-row field;
     built from the exact rows that made the bar. Single-period only (inert in compare
     mode). No migration.

## Directional decisions

- **Build payout (AskUserQuestion):** full **sub-view/tab** (not modal); **persist**
  drafts + approvals (new migration); **per-line override + note** (not just
  include/exclude). Built to all three.
- **Data map:** chose the **iframe** embed (keeps the static snapshot) over a native
  React re-implementation — faithful and fast; native + live data is a later upgrade.
- **Contextual help:** articles as **bundled Markdown strings** (no `help_articles`
  table) — versioned with the code, no extra write path. Shipped framework + seed
  articles; more cards can be covered by adding a `HelpButton` + an article.
- **Conversion drill-down:** **single-period only** (compare mode keeps its A/B
  overlay; click is inert there).

## Verification

`npm install` → `npm run typecheck` ✅ · `npm run verify` ✅ (now **13 sections** — added
§13 build-payout math) · `npm run build` ✅. **UI not browser-tested** (headless
container) — browser/Vercel-preview check all five features.

## Open / next

- **Apply `9989_payout_builds.sql`** (Build payout persistence). The user was applying
  migrations during the session.
- **Backlog now has ONE planned item: Journeys — exclude a mentee.** Deferred for a
  **decision** (asked at session end): it needs a NEW migration (`9988_…`, an
  HJG-owned exclusion table the user must apply) and a **Journeys-only vs
  dashboard-wide** scope choice, and it threads exclusion through the metrics pipeline
  (harder to verify headless). Build once the user picks the approach.
- Carry-over from session 006 still pending: re-sync to populate Pay staff / capacity
  fix / delivery signal; export `ca_invoices` to confirm subscription charges; delete
  the three stale remote branches (proxy-blocked) — though the remote now shows only
  `main`, so those may already be gone.
